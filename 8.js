/**
 * 8) javascript es6 super keyword

Create a JavaScript class named Person with a constructor that takes two parameters: name and age. The class should have a method named introduce that logs a greeting message including the person's name and age.

Next, create a subclass of Person named Student. The Student class should have an additional property named major and an overridden introduce method. The overridden introduce method should log a message that includes the person's name, age, and major.

Example:

const person1 = new Person("John", 30);
person1.introduce(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."

const student1 = new Student("Alice", 20, "Computer Science");

student1.introduce(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 20 years old. I am majoring in Computer Science."
 */

class Person{
    constructor(name,age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
    introduce(){
        console.log("Hello, my name is "+this.name+" and i am "+this.age+" years old." );
    }
}
class Student extends Person{
    constructor(name,age,major)
    {
        super(name,age);
        this.major=major;
    }
    introduce(){
        console.log("Hello, my name is "+this.name+" and i am "+this.age+" years old. I am majoring in "+this.major+" .");
    }
}
const person1 = new Person("John", 30);
person1.introduce(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."

const student1 = new Student("Alice", 20, "Computer Science");

student1.introduce();
